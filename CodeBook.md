##The code book

For almost any data set, the measurements you calculate will need to be described in more detail than you can or should sneak into the spreadsheet. The code book contains this information. At minimum it should contain:

##Data Fields:

##Identifiers

subject - The ID of the test subject
activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

##Measurements

##Activity Labels

*WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
*WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
*WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
*SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
*STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
*LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test

##Information about the summary choices you made

##Information about the experimental study design used
a thorough description of how you collected the data

In our genomics example, the analyst would want to know what the unit of measurement for each clinical/demographic variable is (age in years, treatment by name/dose, level of diagnosis and how heterogeneous). They would also want to know how you picked the exons you used for summarizing the genomic data (UCSC/Ensembl, etc.). They would also want to know any other information about how you did the data collection/study design. For example, are these the first 20 patients that walked into the clinic? Are they 20 highly selected patients by some characteristic like age? Are they randomized to treatments?
