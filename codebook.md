* Walking_Upstairs (v2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
* Walking_Downstairs (v3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
* Sitting (v4): subject was sitting during the test
* Standing (v5): subject was standing during the test
* Laying (v6): subject was laying down during the test

##Information about the experimental study design used
description of how collected the data

1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set
* Reading training tables
* Reading testing tables
* Reading features vector
* Reading activity labels
* Assigning column names
* Merging all data in one dataset
2. Subsetting the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* Reading column names
* Create vector for defining ID, mean and standard deviation ignoring letter case
* Making nessesary subset from the merged data
3. Using descriptive activity names for the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
* Making second tidy data set
* Writing second tidy data set in txt file
